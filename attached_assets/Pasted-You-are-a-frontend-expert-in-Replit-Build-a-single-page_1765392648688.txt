You are a frontend expert in Replit. Build a single page marketing site for a LIVE product called "Swift Shaadi".

Tech:
- Use React with Vite.
- Use simple CSS (single CSS file or modules). No UI library.

Goal:
Create a minimal, smooth, mobile-first landing page with light pastel colors and clean typography. It should feel like a modern SaaS site with a soft Indian wedding vibe, promoting a product that is already live.

Design rules:
- Pastel palette: soft peach, blush pink, mint, lavender, light gold, off white.
- Plenty of white space, rounded cards, subtle shadows.
- No harsh neons.
- Font stack: "SF Pro Text", "Helvetica Neue", system-ui, sans-serif.
- Mobile-first layout, then scale to desktop.
- Smooth scrolling when navbar links are clicked.
- Simple hover states and gentle fade-in transitions.

Structure the page into sections with ids so navbar links scroll there:

1) Navbar (sticky):
   - Left: logo text "Swift Shaadi".
   - Right: links: Features, How it works, Pricing, FAQ plus a primary button "Open app".
   - On scroll, navbar gets a soft background and shadow.

2) Hero section:
   - Headline: "Wedding planning for Indian families, made simple."
   - Subtext: "Swift Shaadi is a live web app that brings guests, invites, schedules, tasks, and budgets together so everyone stays organised and stress stays low."
   - Primary button: "Start planning now".
   - Secondary text link: "See how it works" that scrolls to How it works section.
   - On the right or below on mobile, show a simple card stack / phone mock illustrating the app (dummy UI).

3) Small strip:
   - Text: "Already helping Indian families plan roka, mehendi, sangeet, wedding, and reception in one place."

4) Problem section:
   Heading: "Planning a wedding should not feel chaotic."
   Three small cards:
   - Guest lists scattered across WhatsApp and sheets.
   - No clear view of RSVPs, timeline, and tasks.
   - Hard to align parents, siblings, and planners.

5) Solution section:
   Heading: "Meet Swift Shaadi."
   Subheading: "Designed for Indian weddings. Built for families."
   Three feature cards:
   - Plan in one place – guests, RSVPs, timeline, tasks, budget.
   - Share invites easily – ready templates you copy and send from your own number.
   - Coordinate smoothly – roles for parents, siblings, and cousins.

6) Feature highlights section with simple tabs:
   Tabs: "Guests & RSVPs", "Invite templates", "Timeline & tasks", "Budget overview".
   Clicking a tab updates:
   - A short description paragraph.
   - A simple illustrative card on the side (e.g., list of guests, a template preview, a timeline, a budget card).

7) How it works section:
   Heading: "Start using Swift Shaadi in three simple steps."
   Steps:
   1. Create your wedding – add names, date, and city.
   2. Add guests, events, and tasks – keep everything in one space.
   3. Share invite messages and track RSVPs – copy templates, send from your phone, update responses.
   Include a small “Open app” button here.

8) Pricing teaser:
   Two cards side by side (stacked on mobile):
   - Free plan – Available now.
     List: guests & RSVPs, invite templates, timeline, tasks, budget.
   - Premium – Coming soon.
     List: vendor marketplace, payment tracking, live updates, file storage, advanced analytics.
   Premium card has a small lock icon or “Coming soon” label.

9) Social proof section:
   Heading: "Loved by modern Indian families."
   Two or three testimonial cards with short quotes and names, e.g.:
   - “We finally organised everything without five different spreadsheets.”
   - “My parents could see tasks clearly and felt in control.”
   Keep them as simple static cards.

10) FAQ:
   Heading: "Frequently asked questions."
   Use simple accordions for questions:
   - Is Swift Shaadi free to use?
   - Can my parents and siblings also log in?
   - Do you send WhatsApp messages automatically?
   - Does this work on my phone?
   Provide short clear answers, emphasising that the app is already live and works on mobile browsers.

11) Final CTA section:
   Heading: "Ready to make wedding planning calmer?"
   Subtext: "Open Swift Shaadi, create your wedding, and invite your family to plan together today."
   Button: "Open Swift Shaadi".

12) Footer:
   Small footer bar.
   Text: "© 2025 Swift Shaadi. Made with love for Indian families."
   Links for: Features, How it works, Pricing, FAQ, Contact, Privacy, Terms (can be placeholder anchors).

Implementation details:
- Put all sections in App.tsx (or a few components) and wire navbar links using scrollIntoView or similar.
- Use React state for active feature tab and FAQ accordion open/close.
- Use CSS for layout and animations with flexbox and max-width containers.
- Make sure it looks good on mobile first, then add media queries for larger screens.
